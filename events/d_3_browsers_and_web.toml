**The goal of this track is to craft a vision of IPFS in the web and browsers which is truly
 native to *both*, and a roadmap for achieving it.**

The web platform itself is a massive heterogenious ecosystem with unique challenges for new protocols (something which has never happened in a meaningful way) and stakeholders with particular requirements and a diverse vision of what the web actually is and can be. We need to define a way for IPFS be a deployment channel for HTML/JS/CSS, have a clearly defined security model for that content, such that both web standards and browser vendor stakeholders can reason about it and ultimately implement it.

Additionally, extra-web browser features and extensibility channels like browser extensions offer different capabilities, audiences and constraints. We must determine what the optimal strategy is for augmenting user experience of the regular web through the opportunities we have which are *adjacent* to it - eg connecting to local IPFS nodes, building browser extensions which read from or write to IPFS, or enabling users to move HTTP content to IPFS.

Finally, looking beyond existing browser channels, how can we redefine or leapfrog today's web using entirely new approaches such as removing existing browser metaphors or building mobile operating systems from the ground up with IPFS at the center.

This track is structured as an _intense_ half-day workshop. It will start with a
 brief introduction to frame our work, we'll hear lightning talks on use cases, 
then move to group discussion, using a design document for group iteration.

Bring your ideas, use-cases, needs and we'll redefine the track as needed before kicking off.
